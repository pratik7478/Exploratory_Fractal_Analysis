# Exploratory_Fractal_Analysis

### A Fractal is a structure whose dimensions cannot be represented as a whole integers.

Fractal analysis is assessing fractal characteristics of data.
It consists of several methods to assign a fractal dimension and other fractal characteristics to a dataset which may be a theoretical dataset, 
or a pattern or signal extracted from phenomena including natural geometric objects, ecology and aquatic sciences, sound, market fluctuations,
heart rates, frequency domain in electroencephalography signals, digital images, molecular motion, and data science.
Fractal analysis is now widely used in all areas of science.

Here, I have used to techniques to determine fractal dimensions: - 
1) Hurst Exponent: - 

Hurst exponent is calculated by plotting the rescaled range against the time interval on a log-log graph.
The slope value of the straight line fitting the graph is the value of Hurst Exponent.

2) DFA: - 

Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a method for determining the statistical self-affinity of a signal. 
It is useful for analysing time series that appear to be long-memory processes.
